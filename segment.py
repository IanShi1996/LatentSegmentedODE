    """Estimate log marginal likelihood through parallel MC sampling.

    Computes Monte Carlo importance sampling estimation of log p(x).
    Several observations are exploited to allow combination of segments into
    one batch:

    1. Encoder output is deterministic, meaning each input trajectory needs
       one computation to obtain the variational posterior.
    2. ODE solutions scales well as number of timepoints solved increases.
       Thus, we can combine all segmentations by first scaling the timepoints
       such that the first timepoint is 0, and then finding the set union of
       all timepoints for all trajectories. These time deltas are rounded
       to a decimal precision to save compute.

    All these steps result in a ~30x speed up compared to the sequential
    implementation.

    Further speed-up can likely be obtained by optimizing encoder masking and
    score computation, but gains are marginal at this point.

    The fixed variance used to calculate reconstruction error can be modified.
    Performance seems to be best when this is set to match the variance used
    during model training.

    """Perform segmentation using OPTSEG or PELT algorithm.

    Computes segmentation of a time series using an optimal partitioning
    algorithm. All possible segmentations are evaluated using dynamic
    programming. Non-optimal changepoints can be discarded under a pruning
    condition. The optimal segmentation and pruned exact linear time (PELT)
    method are adapted from the PELT paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1101.1438.pdf

    The PELT prune condition requires there exist a K such that:
        C(X_s:t) + C(X_t:T) + K <= C(X_s:T)
    This condition is true for K=0 when the cost function assumes i.i.d. data,
    but fails for the Segmented NODE model. Thus, K needs to be empirically
    specified. Increasing K will consider more segments, increasing runtime.

    This function can be converted to optimal segmentation by specifying a very
    high K term, such as np.inf, disallowing discarding of changepoints.

    Previously, a penalization parameter for approximating the BIC existed,
    but has been removed as taking MC estimates of log p(x) allows segmentation
    without penalization, due to the Bayesian Occam's Razor effect:
